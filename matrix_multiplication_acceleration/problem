# Neural Network Acceleration

Neural networks are widely used in various fields and applications.
With the rise of mobile terminals, neural networks are becoming more common on
mobile phones, tablets, and other devices which require real-time performance of
neural networks. Sparsification of neural networks is often involved to increase
their performance, but, unfortunately, it also reduces their accuracy.
Finding a way to reasonably sparsify a neural network becomes a challenge.In
this problem, a neural network of depth d is represented as d matrices
A_1, A_2, ..., A_d, where each matrix A_i consists of n rows and n columns.
The process of the neural network is equivalent to calculation of matrix product
A_1 * A_2 * ... * A_d.
Matrix multiplication is performed sequentially from left to right:
first calculate A_1 * A_2 = B_2, then B_2 * A_3 = B_3,
and so on with B_d being the final result.
Please note that it is not allowed to change the order of multiplication of the
matrices. Simply put, sparsification of the neural network can be boiled down to
setting some elements in the matrices A_i to 0. The point of sparsification
is that if a matrix element is zero, then it is no use to multiply it by other
elements of the matrices. This way, several multiplications of elements may be
saved. At the same time, after sparsification, elements of the resulting matrix
must be accurate enough so that the neural network remains useful.You are given
a neural network in the form of matrices A_i. Your task is to sparsify it in
such a way that its performance and accuracy are as balanced as possible, and
accuracy of the neural network does not fall below a certain threshold.
See the Scoring section for details.
